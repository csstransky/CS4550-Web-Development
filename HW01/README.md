# Homework 01
### Cristian Stransky  
  
I included both the html files and nginx configure files for both websites.   
  
The configuration files are located in **nginx/sites-available/\<site name\>**  
The html files are located in **html/\<site name\>/index.html**  
  
I also included the images used by the hw01 site as well inside the site's html folder. 
  
Homework 01 website:  
[hw01.cstransky.me](http://hw01.cstransky.me)

Note: *hw01.csstransky.duckdns.org* was used as a temporary domain name so I could complete
this homework before the due date; it is included in this repo as well. The domain name
is also still hosted on my private server that will direct you to the true domain name 
so there is no confusion during grading.
