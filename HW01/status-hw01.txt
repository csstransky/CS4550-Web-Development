Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Cristian Stransky


2. Which VPS & domain providers did you choose?
I'm using a private home server made from spare computer parts:
CPU: Dual-core i3-2100 3.1 GHz
RAM: 4GB DDR3 
Storage: 640 GB 7200RPM HDD
OS: Ubuntu Server 18.04.1 LTS

This means that my ports are forwarded on my modem, and my OS runs a 
periodic crontab to update its IP to a dynamic DNS server, since my 
ISP uses dynamic IP addresses (I commute, so this is done completely 
outside NEU).

For my domain name, I'm temporarily using a subdomain from 
https://duckdns.org until I'm finally verified as a student by GitHub
Education to use a free namecheap .me domain name later.


3. What domain name did you register?
csstransky.duckdns.org (to be changed in the future)


4. What's the URL of your Github repository for this assignment?
https://github.com/csstransky/CS4550-Web-Development/tree/master/HW01


5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Trying to find a way to get a free domain name.


6. Did you complete your Bottlenose profile with a picture and 
reasonable name?
Yes.
