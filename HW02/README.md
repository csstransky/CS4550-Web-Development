#### For Part B:  
**This calculator remembers past operations and uses PEMDAS when  
calculating**, meaning inputting "4\*4-10/2" will not equal "3", but instead  
equal "11". This can be reset by clicking the red "C" button, which will  
clear the entire equation and allow you to start anew.  
  
If you wish to see the current stored equation, you can press **"F12"**  
(tested in Firefox) to open the console in your web browser and see the  
console output. 
  
**This calculator does not allow for negative numbers to be input,** but does  
allow for negative numbers to be an answer.  
  
**This calculator also does not have have iterative operator functionality,**  
meaning if press the plus/equals button multiple times in a row, it will not  
repeat the last operation multiple in a row ("10-2===" won't equal "4"), but  
instead wait for another number to be input.
