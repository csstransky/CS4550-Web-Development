Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Cristian Stransky

2. What hostname did you deploy to for Task 2?
hw03.cstransky.me

3. What's the URL of your git repo for Task 2?
https://github.com/csstransky/CS4550-Web-Development/tree/master/HW03

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
All 4 functions.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
Yes, even set up the systemd file to start the website on reboot (included in 
the repo).

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
Somewhat comfortable, I still have issues writing good tail recursive functions
instead of the usual stack resursive functions.

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Doing the expression Practice.Calc.calc() function. I foolishly followed Tuck's
advice function for function, but decided it's much easier to put the 
expression into postfix (or prefix) then simply evaluate from there instead of 
converting from postfix to prefix, then evaluating. Also, "tagging" operations 
([{:num, "3"}, {:op, "+"}, {:num, "10"}) was mostly useless and superfluous.

Deployment was also difficult because I actually ran out of inodes on my server
while deploying my page, and it took me a while to find the problem and fix it
(I eventually cleared my /tmp and /var/log/ folders, which funnily created a 
small problem with nginx in the process, but fixed my inode problem).
